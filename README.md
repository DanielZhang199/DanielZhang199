- 👋 Hi, I’m @DanielZhang199
- 👀 I’m interested in anything CS related, but especially in exploring algorithms and AI
- 🌱 I’m currently still a student attending university, and just having fun with any projects I feel won't take up too much time
- 💞️ If you really believe I have the skills to help with anything, I will be glad to collaborate on anything
- 📫 I don't believe anyone will want to reach me, but you can email me at: dzhang35@student.ubc.ca
